The field of data engineering concerns itself with the mechanics of flow and access of data and it's goal is to make quality data available for fact finding and data driven decision making.

The world of data has grown to include wide ranging sources, structures and types of data.

The field of data engineering involves:

Collecting source data, processing data, storing data and making data available to users securely.


# **Collecting source data**

Includes:


* Extracting, integrating and organizing data from disparate sources. 

* To collect required data, tools, workflows and processes that need to be developed to help acquire data from multiple sources. 

* A scalable data architecture needs to be designed, built and maintained to store data. 

* Data can be stored in databases, data warehouses data lakes or any other type of data repository.

# *Processing Data**

Includes:

* Cleaning, transforming and preparing so that it is usable.

* Distributed systems for large-scale processing of data need to be implemented and maintained.

* Pipelines need to be designed for extraction, transformation and loading of data into data repositories.

* Solutions for validating and safeguarding quality, privacy and security of data need to be designed or implemented.

* Tools, systems and workflows should be optimized for performance reliability and scalability/

* Data should be ensured to meet all regulatory and compliance guidelines.

# **Storing data**

Includes:

* Storing data for reliability and easy viability of data needs.

* Architecture or implementation of data stores for storage of processed data.

* Systems should be ensured to be scalable, keeping in mind the evolving nature of data and business needs.

* Ensuring tools and systems are in place to take care of data privacy, security and compliance monitoring and back up and recovery.

# **Making data available to users securely**

This includes:

* The use of APIs, services and programs that retrieve data on defined parameters for use by end users.

* Interfaces and dashboards that present data to users so they can derive insights from the data.

* Ensure the right measures and checks and balances are in place to keep data secure and provide right space to access to users.



Data engineering is a team job. No one person is expected to have the knowledge, skills and specializations for the wide ranging tasks covered in the scope for data engineering.

For example: 

* To architect any data management system be it for collecting source data or storing processed analyzed data, the skills of an architect are needed. 

* To ensure data stores are available and optimized for use, expertise in databases is needed.

* Proficiency in database tools, programming languages and distributed systems all come under data engineering, but they may require different skill sets.

* Not all teams and organizations need to set up data engineering practice. There are tools, applications and solutions available in the market, both on-premise and cloud-based that can be evaluated for individual needs


# Conclusion

The field of data engineering provides a robust and scalable structure to make quality data available for decision making. It includes the tools and technologies invited in data manipulation. It also involves the understanding of the complexities of data and how it is leveraged for fact finding and decision making.
