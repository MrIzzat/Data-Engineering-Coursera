The **Modern Data Ecosystem** contains a whole network of interconnected, independant and continuouly evolving entities. 

It includes:

* data that is integrated from disparate sources.
* Differente types of analysis and skills to generate insights.
* Active stakeholders to colloborate and act on insights generated.
* Tools, applications, and infrastructure to store, process and disseminate data as required.


# Data Sources

Data is available in a lot of structured and unstructured data sets.

The data can be in text files, images, videos, click streams, user conversations social media platforms, IoT devices, real time events that stream data, legacy databases or data sources from professional data providers and agencies.

The first step is to pull a copy of the data from the data sources into a data repository.

Some of the challenges include: Data reliability, security and integrity, at this stage.

# Data Storing

Once the raw data reaches the data repository, it needs to be organized cleaned up and optimized for access by end-users.

The data should be conformed to compliances and standards enfornced in the organization.

The key challenges at this stage include: data management and working with data repositories that provide high availability, flexbility, acessbility and security.


# Users


Users can include:

* Business stakeholders
* Apps
* Programmers and analysts
* Data science use cases

All of these could be pulling data from the data repository

The challenges at this stage include: The interfaces, APIs and applications that can get this data to the end users in line with their specific needs. 

For example, data analysts may prefer to work with the raw data while business stakeholders just need the reports. Applications need custom APIs to pull these data.


Cloud techonologies, machine learning and Big data are emerging technologies shaping modern data ecosystem.
