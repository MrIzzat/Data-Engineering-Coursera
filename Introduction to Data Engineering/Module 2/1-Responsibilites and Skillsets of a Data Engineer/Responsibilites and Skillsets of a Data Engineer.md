The overarching responsibility of a data engineer is to provide analytics ready data to data consumers.

Data is analytics ready when:

* Accurate
* Reliable
* Complies to regulations it is governed by
* Accessible to customers when it is needed


At a broad level, data engineers:

* Extract, organize and integrate data from disparate sources
* Prepare data for analysis and reporting by cleaning it and transforming it
* Design and manage data pipelines that encompass the journey of data from source to destination systems
* Setup and manage the infrastructure required for the ingestion, processing and storage of data. This can include data platforms, data stores for aggregating source data distributed system for large scale process of data and data repositories for storage and dissemination of analysis ready data



# Technical Skills

* Knowledge of working operating systems such as UNIX, LINUX and windows. Knowledge about commonly used administrative tools and system utilities and commands are also needed.

* Knowledge of infrastructure components like virtual machines, networking, application services (load balancing and application performance monitoring), cloud-based services (amazon, google, ibm, microsoft etc.)

* Experience working with databases and data warehouses such as: Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS): like IBM DB2, mysql, oracle and PostgresSQL. NoSQL databases: like Redis, mongodb, cassandra and neo4j. Data warehouses like: oracle exadata, IBM db2 warehouse on cloud, IBM netezza performance server, amazon redshift.

* A high level of proficient working with data pipelines: like apache beam, airflow and data flow.

* Experience working with ETL tools: like IBM infospehere information server, AWS glue and improvado.

* Proficiency in languages for querying, manipulating and processing data: Query languages for accessing and manipulating data in a database like SQL for relational database and sql-like query languages for NoSQL databases. Programming languages like python, R and Java. Shell and scripting languages: like Unix/Linux shell and power shell.

* Familiarity with big data processing tools, like Hadoop, Hive and Apache Spark.


Having knowledge of different tools allows a data engineer to make appropriate recommendations.


Data engineering falls in between software engineering and data science.


# Functional Skills

Data engineers need to know how data scientists, analysts and business users use analysis ready data. 

Some functional skills for a data engineer:

* Ability to convert business requirements into technical specification.
* Ability to work with the complete software development life cycles, this includes: ideation, architecture, design, prototyping, testing deploying and monitoring.
* Understanding data's potential application in business
* Understanding the risks of poor data management: such as poor data quality, data privacy, security and compliance


# Soft skills

Data engineering is a team based job. Data engineers can and will often work with other teams of data analysts, business users, data scientists, technical teams etc.

Teamwork, interpersonal skills, collaborations and effective communication with technical and non-technicals people are needed for a data engineer.
